A game I would want to make is Icy Tower.
 The game is shaped through the vertical axis.
 The character keeps bouncing higher on platforms with no end-goal.
 It’s more about how far can you reach with all these objects
 making it harder.
 Such objects as spikes on a platform so accuracy is a must or
 the screen moving through the vertical axis faster so their
 is less time to fix a mistake.
 If you hit one of the spikes or the screen passes you,
 the player loses.
 I want to build this game because it reminds me of high school.
 This was a game we could play without the proxy denying access
 to the website. 

Another game I would like to make is Temple Run.
 It is very similar to icy tower expect it moves on a horizontal
 axis rather than the vertical axis.
 The game seems infinite, but has conditions that can cause the
 player to lose.
 The game automatically move you forward but conditions such as
 a rock on the path, making a wrong turn or simply turning to
 late can cause the player to lose.
 The reason I want to make this game is because I remember the
 countless hours I spent trying to beat other people high scores
 to eventually trying to surpass my own. 


The last game I would want to make is called Balloon Tower defense.
 It’s about using the right characters who all have their own
 unique abilities to break down the balloons to stop them from
 reaching the end point.
 All balloons defeated, you win the level, if one reachs the end
 you lose.
 The balloons have a health bar so it takes multiple hits to
 take it out.
 I like that there are many different ways you can play the
 game, and at times changing the strategy to get the win.
 As well as the defending people the player uses have upgrade
 features which makes it more exciting as you move on to the
 next level.

this is edit so i can do process again.
